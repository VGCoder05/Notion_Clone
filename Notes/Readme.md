## Stage 1 (Page Hierachy & Linking) - 22/06/25

#### What is done

Made a "Sidebar" which has 1 main btn - it allows to create new notes

All the pages are being "routed" so on clicking them it opens respective page.
 => We get the page "id" & then we search that page from the user data & display it's content

> ! Doubt: Should i make "search" window as a page or component & I want to make it in a manner that it pop up when we click on search link/btn on **sidebar**, so should i make it routed or simple mounte & unmount it.

## Stage 1 (Content blocks) - 22/06/25

> ! Doubt: How should i structure the blocks, in data & load them in page.

**! Feature**: Add the feature which keeps the default name of page "New Page" & can be changed when user type in "Page_name" block.
